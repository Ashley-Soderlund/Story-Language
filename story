It has been weeks, but the group had almost made it. We were sent on a journey to gather information 
from an opposing faction. It was an in and out job, though there were complications. The in part was simple,
but we still haven't gotten away. We are a few miles out, but they have been on our tails. Constantly finding 
us. Our only hope is to make it back to base, to the rest of our team, for support.

The forest seems so wide and vast. The trees tower over us. The sound of leaves cruching as our feet run. 
The wizz of arrows by our heads. They seem to be coming from all angles. We are outnumbered.
Do we climb a tree and wait out the persuers or keep running?
